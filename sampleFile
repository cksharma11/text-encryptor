My best friend is Archana from the school time. We are good friends from the childhood and still continue. She is a smart girl having fair complexion and dimpled cheeks. She is a pretty girl, I like so much her. I still remember that we were met in our kindergarten class and became great friends forever. She is very entertaining, jolly and helpful in nature. She understands me a lot and become always ready to help me in my all bad or happy conditions. We are classmates and become together every time. We go to the school everyday together and play sports daily in the nearby ground of our house.
